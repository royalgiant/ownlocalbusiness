# Ownlocalbusiness

The app runs on ruby version 2.1.5, change it to the version you use on the gemfile or rvm to ruby -v 2.1.5

Run `bundle install` to get the correct packages

Install Pow (allows us to work with subdomains easily ONLY for OS X):
- curl get.pow.cx | sh
- cd ~/.pow
- ln ~/Developer/ownlocalbusiness (I kept my "ownlocal" app in ~/Developer, do this to create symlink)
